# Garry – Syntax

Garry’s syntax is **pattern-based** and extremely minimal.

- Utterances are sequences of **1–N `gary` tokens**.
- There are no explicit function words; roles are inferred from:
  - token shape (morphology)
  - order
  - prosody and context
  - agreed-upon patterns (lexicon)

## 1. Utterance Length

### 1.1 Single-Token Utterances

- 1 token expresses a **state or stance**.

Examples:

- `gary.` – neutral acknowledgement / “OK / I’m here.”
- `gary?` – “You?” / “Really?” / “What?”
- `gary!` – “Hey!” / “Stop!” / “Look!”
- `gary…` – “I’m tired / unsure / letting this hang.”
- `gáary.` – gentle, inviting presence.
- `GARY!` – full alarm / “NOW.”

### 1.2 Two-Token Utterances

- 2 tokens typically express a **relation or reaction**.

Examples:

- `gary. gary!` – “I agree and I’m energized.” (steady → push)
- `gary? gary.` – “Are you okay? I’m okay / it’s fine.” (check → reassure)
- `gary… gary.` – “I’m low, but I’ll manage / I’m still here.”
- `gaary. gary.` – “I’m being gentle; we’re good.”
- `GARY. gary.` – hard boundary, then normalization: “Enough; we move on.”

### 1.3 Three-Token Utterances

- 3 tokens map well onto **subject – action – mood** or **situation – reaction – outcome**.

Examples:

- `gary? gary! gary.`  
  - Question → decision → resolution.  
  - “Should we? Let’s do it. Done.”

- `gaary. gary. garyyy…`  
  - Gentle acceptance → steady execution → lingering feeling.  
  - “I agree, we’ll do it, but I have emotions about it.”

- `g-g-gary. gaary? gary…`  
  - Hesitation → soft question → trailing doubt.  
  - “I’m anxious, trying to ask; if it’s not okay, I’ll back off.”

## 2. Default Interpretation Heuristics

When interpreting a multi-token utterance:

1. **First token**: stance toward subject / situation.
2. **Second token**: action / shift / relation or response.
3. **Third token (if present)**: emotional consequence or after-state.

Example:

- `gáry gary! gàry…`  
  - `gáry` – outward / positive orientation.  
  - `gary!` – decisive action.  
  - `gàry…` – internal withdrawal afterward.  
  → “I pushed forward, then regretted or tired out.”

## 3. Clustering vs Spacing

- `gary gary gary.` → sequential acts or evolving stance.
- `garygary gary.` → more compressed first two tokens, higher urgency or emotional fusion.

By default, tokens are **space-separated**. Fused forms should be treated as stylistic intensification and require shared understanding.

---

## 4. Thematic Length Mapping

A practical rule of thumb:

- 1 token – state / ping / emotional flash.
- 2 tokens – relation / reaction / agreement / disagreement.
- 3 tokens – mini-story (situation → action → outcome).
- 4+ tokens – narrative, rant, or layered internal monologue.

The language spec only **requires** definitions for core 1–3 token patterns. Longer sequences are built from those and should be interpreted compositionally.

## 5. Canonical Narrative Sentence

Analogue to:

> “The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.”

Canonical Garry version:

> `gáry gary! gaary garyyy, gàry… gary.`

Suggested interpretive parse:

- `gáry` – energetic, outward-turning subject (quick fox).
- `gary!` – sudden, focused action (the leap).
- `gaary` – elongated motion (taking off).
- `garyyy,` – sustained arc (over).
- `gàry…` – low-energy, unmoving target (lazy dog).
- `gary.` – closure, scene resolved.

This sentence is recommended as the **demo line** for showing Garry’s expressive capacity.
