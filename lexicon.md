# Garry – Lexicon (Canonical Patterns)

Garry has no traditional word list. Instead, it has **canonical token patterns** and **multi-token phrases** with agreed implied meanings.

This file defines a **starter lexicon**.

| `gäry?`     | Maybe another way? / What if we do it differently?      |
| `gãryyyy…`  | This is vague / I don’t fully understand my feelings.   |

Interpretations are intentionally fuzzy but stable enough to be reused.

## 4. Canonical Narrative Sentence

Analogue to:

> “The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.”

Garry:

> `gáry gary! gaary garyyy, gàry… gary.`

Suggested gloss:

- `gáry` – energetic, outward agent (quick fox)
- `gary!` – sudden action (jump)
- `gaary` – extended takeoff (leap)
- `garyyy,` – sustained path (over)
- `gàry…` – low, lazy presence (dog)
- `gary.` – resolved state (scene finished)

This is recommended as a **canonical example** in teaching materials.

## 5. Extending the Lexicon

New entries should:

1. Respect the **token rule** (g–a–r–y in order).
2. Be described by **form + gloss + context notes**.
3. Embrace **soft, implied meanings**, not rigid denotations.

Example of adding a new canonical:

- Form: `gâary! gary!`  
- Gloss: “This specific plan, now.”  
- Notes: use when insisting on a particular option among several.
