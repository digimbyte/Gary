# Gary Language

**Gary** is a deliberately hyper-minimal constructed language.

- It has **one** lexical root: `gary`.
- Every spoken or written “word” must contain the full sequence **g–a–r–y**.
- There are **no other roots, no pronouns, no separate verbs**.
- All nuance comes from **how** you shape `gary`: length, diacritics, rhythm, pitch, repetition, and punctuation.

Gary is not built to be a full replacement for natural language. It’s a **high-context signal language** and a design toy for thinking about:

- How much meaning humans can squeeze from **prosody and pattern**, not vocabulary.
- How subtext, attitude, and relationship are communicated **indirectly**.
- How a “language” can be as much a **charade system** as a code.

## Core Idea

1. **Only one written token**: `gary`  
   - Variants must preserve the sequence `g` + `a` + `r` + `y`.  
   - Diacritics are allowed on `a` (e.g. `gáry`, `gàry`, `gâry`, `gäry`, `gãry`).  
   - Lengthening is allowed: `gaary`, `gaaary`, `garyyy`, `gaaryyy`, etc.

2. **Meaning comes from modifiers**:
   - Length of `a` and `y`
   - Diacritics on `a`
   - Case (`gary` vs `GARY`)
   - Punctuation (`gary.`, `gary?`, `gary!`, `gary…`)
   - Rhythmic effects such as stutter: `g-g-gary`

3. **Syntax is pattern-based**:
   - 1 token → state / stance  
   - 2–3 tokens → relation / action / consequence  
   - 4+ tokens → narrative, rant, or layered emotion

4. **Pragmatics are essential**:
   - Eye contact, pointing, posture, and timing are part of the message.
   - Gary assumes a shared context. It is intentionally **indirect and implied**.

## Example

Canonical example mirroring  
> “The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.”

In Gary:

> `gáry gary! gaary garyyy, gàry… gary.`

- `gáry gary!` → active, outward agent suddenly acting (quick fox).  
- `gaary garyyy,` → smooth leap in an arc (jumped over).  
- `gàry… gary.` → low-energy, unmoving presence, then resolution (lazy dog, scene finished).

## What This Repo Contains

- `principles.md` – design goals and core constraints  
- `phonology_orthography.md` – how to pronounce and write Gary  
- `morphology.md` – how a single `gary` token can be modified  
- `syntax.md` – how tokens combine into utterances  
- `lexicon.md` – canonical patterns and their implied meanings  
- `examples.md` – dialogues and narrative samples in Gary

Garry is intentionally small, but its **complexity is emergent**, not lexical. The fun is in how far you can push one word.
