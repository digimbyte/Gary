Garry is a deliberately absurdly-minimal language: every “word” is just gary, altered. No extra roots, no auxiliary verbs, no separate pronouns. You only ever say gary—but you bend it with length, diacritics, rhythm, pitch, repetition, and punctuation to encode meaning. It’s half conlang, half social game, and it relies on implication and shared context rather than explicit vocabulary.

At the orthographic level, Garry is strict and simple:

The only token is gary (with the sequence g–a–r–y preserved).

You can stretch letters (gaary, garyyy), add diacritics on a (gáry, gãry etc.), change case (gary vs GARY), stutter (g-g-gary), and use punctuation (gary?, gary…, gary!).
All of these act as semantic modifiers—not new words. One token, many shades.

The real complexity is emergent, not lexical. Sequences of 1–3 garys become “sentences” whose meaning is driven by pattern and performance:

gary. gary! → confident yes / “I agree, let’s do it.”

gary… gaary. → reluctant acceptance.

GARY. gary. → hard boundary, then normalization.

g-g-gary… → anxiety or social hesitation.
Layer body language on top (eye contact, pointing, posture) and Garry turns into a charade-based communication system where nuance is carried as much by how you say it as what you say—because the “what” is always the same.

In short: Garry is a one-word, high-context language for implied communication. It’s perfect for in-jokes, roleplay, social signaling, or as a design toy for thinking about prosody, subtext, and how much meaning humans can squeeze out of almost no vocabulary at all.
