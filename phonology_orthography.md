# Garry – Phonology & Orthography

## 1. Segment Inventory

Garry uses the following underlying segments:

- `g` – voiced velar stop, e.g. [g]
- `a` – front/open vowel in the [a ~ æ ~ ɛ] region
- `r` – rhotic consonant, e.g. [ɹ] or [r]
- `y` – high front vowel, e.g. [i] or [ɪ]

Canonical approximations (all valid):

- /ˈgæ.ri/
- /ˈga.ri/
- /ˈgɛ.ri/
- /ˈgɛə.ri/

Garry does **not** enforce a single value; it defines a **vowel band**.

## 2. Orthographic Rules

### 2.1 Base Form

- The base orthographic form is:

> `gary`

- Spelling is strictly **g–a–r–y** in that order.
- There is **no `e`** in any canonical spelling.

### 2.2 Lengthening

Two types of lengthening are allowed:

1. Lengthening `a`:

   - `gaary`, `gaaary`, `gaaaary`, etc.
   - Interpreted as increased **magnitude, intensity, scale**.

2. Lengthening `y`:

   - `garyy`, `garyyy`, `garyyyy`, etc.
   - Interpreted as increased **duration, openness, lingering**.

These may be combined:

- `gaaryyy`, `gaaaryy`, etc.

### 2.3 Diacritics on `a`

The `a` may take diacritics. Canonical set:

- `gáry`
- `gàry`
- `gâry`
- `gäry`
- `gãry`

Conceptually, diacritics define a **2D semantic navigation**:

| Form   | Semantic bias                             |
|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| `gáry` | outward / positive / approaching          |
| `gàry` | inward / withdrawing / reluctant          |
| `gâry` | focused / precise / “this specifically”   |
| `gäry` | sideways / alternative / divergent        |
| `gãry` | diffuse / fuzzy / dreamy / unresolved     |

Any of these can also be lengthened:

- `gáary`, `gàaryyy`, `gãary…`, etc.

---

## 3. Case

Case is used as an emphasis marker:

- `gary` – neutral
- `GARY` – shouted, high urgency, strong imperative

Mixed case (e.g. `GaRy`) has no special status in the core spec and should be treated as stylistic only, unless otherwise agreed in a sub-dialect.

---

## 4. Punctuation

Punctuation applies at the **token level**:

- `gary.` – statement / acknowledgement / factual stance
- `gary?` – interrogative / prompt / seeking stance
- `gary!` – imperative / alert / exclamation
- `gary…` – trailing / incomplete / introspective / unresolved

Punctuation can be combined with diacritics and length:

- `gáary?`
- `gàry…`
- `gâry!`
- `gãaryyy…`

---

## 5. Rhythmic Effects

### 5.1 Stutter

A token may include stuttered onsets indicated with hyphens:

- `g-g-gary`
- `g-gary`
- `g—gary` (em dash for harder break)

Stuttered `gary` typically implies:

- hesitation
- anxiety
- excitement too strong for smooth speech

### 5.2 Timing and Spacing

In written form:

- Single spaces separate tokens: `gary. gary! gary…`
- Line breaks may indicate stronger prosodic pauses or discourse boundaries.

In spoken form, timing between tokens is part of the message and should be treated as part of the pragmatic layer (see `06_examples.md`).

---

## 6. Token Definition

For the purposes of morphology and syntax:

> A **token** is any orthographic form that:
> - preserves `g` + modified `a` + `r` + modified `y`
> - may include diacritics on `a`
> - may include repeated `a` and/or `y`
> - may appear with case, punctuation, and stutter markers

Examples:

- `gary.`
- `gaary?`
- `gáry!`
- `gàry…`
- `garyyy…`
- `g-g-gary!`
- `GÂARY!`

All of the above count as **one token** in syntax.
