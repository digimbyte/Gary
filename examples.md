## 4. Internal Monologue (4+ Tokens)

> `gary… gàry… gãryyyy… gaary. gary.`

Interpretation:

- `gary…` – Generic low energy / “ugh.”
- `gàry…` – Pulling inward / “I want to withdraw.”
- `gãryyyy…` – Emotional fog / “I don’t fully understand this.”
- `gaary. gary.` – Gentle self-acceptance / “It’s okay; I’m here.”

This would be analogous to an internal scene of someone processing a bad day and self-soothing.

## 5. The Canonical Fox–Dog Sentence

Analogue of:

> “The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.”

In Garry:

> **`gáry gary! gaary garyyy, gàry… gary.`**

Suggested performance:

1. `gáry` – Slightly uplifted tone, quick onset.  
2. `gary!` – Short, sharp, with a little physical “spring” gesture.  
3. `gaary` – Stretched `aa`, like taking off.  
4. `garyyy,` – Gliding `yyy`, like an arc, with a hand movement.  
5. `gàry…` – Low pitch, downward hand / eyes, signaling laziness.  
6. `gary.` – Flat, small nod: scene closed.

This line showcases:

- diacritics (`á`, `à`)
- lengthening of `a` and `y`
- punctuation (`!`, `,`, `…`, `.`)
- multi-token narrative structure
