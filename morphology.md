# Garry – Morphology

Garry’s morphology is **monomorphemic** at the root level: there is only `gary`.  
All meaningful variation comes from **token-level modifications**.

---

## 1. Morphological Dimensions

Each `gary` token can be described along these axes:

1. **Vowel length** (A-length, Y-length)
2. **Diacritic on A**
3. **Case** (neutral vs shout)
4. **Punctuation**
5. **Rhythmic framing** (stutter, timing – written as hyphens)

---

## 2. Vowel Length

### 2.1 A-Length

Forms:

- `gary` (no extra `a`)
- `gaary`
- `gaaary`
- `gaaaary`
- etc.

Interpretation:

- More `a` → more **scale / intensity / emphasis**.

Example gloss tendencies:

- `gary.` – neutral stance
- `gaary.` – somewhat stronger stance / more emotional weight
- `gaaary.` – very strong, intense stance
- `gaaaary.` – extreme, overwhelming scale

### 2.2 Y-Length

Forms:

- `gary`
- `garyy`
- `garyyy`
- `garyyyy`
- etc.

Interpretation:

- More `y` → more **duration / openness / lingering / uncertainty or yearning**.

Example tendencies:

- `gary.` – discrete, bounded
- `garyy.` – slightly lingering, softer
- `garyyy…` – strongly lingering, unresolved, or wistful

## 3. Diacritics on A

Diacritics modulate **attitude and direction** of the token’s stance:

| Token | Bias                                          |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `gáry` | outward, inviting, optimistic, approach       |
| `gàry` | inward, withdrawing, tired, reluctant         |
| `gâry` | focused, precise, analytical, “this one”      |
| `gäry` | sideways, alternative, playful, divergent     |
| `gãry` | blurred, dreamy, ambiguous, liminal           |

Combined with length, you read them as layered:

- `gáary!` – strong, inviting push (“come on, let’s do this”)
- `gàry…` – withdrawing, tired, “I’m pulling back”
- `gãaryyyy…` – drifting, unresolved, “I don’t know what this is yet”

---

## 4. Case

- `gary` – neutral intensity
- `GARY` – shouted, high urgency, force, alarm, anger, or emphasis

Case does not change the core meaning class of the token, only its **strength**.

---

## 5. Punctuation Categories

- `.` – statement / assertion / acknowledgement
- `?` – question / prompt / uncertainty / request for response
- `!` – imperative / alert / surprised or strong reaction
- `…` – trailing / incomplete / reflective / emotionally unresolved

Examples:

- `gaary.` – gentle assertion
- `gaary?` – gentle question / check-in
- `gaary!` – warm, encouraging push
- `gaary…` – soft, hesitant sharing

---

## 6. Rhythmic Morphology

### 6.1 Stutter

Hyphenated initial consonants:

- `g-gary`
- `g-g-gary`
- `g—gary`

These indicate a disrupted onset, reflecting:

- fear
- nervousness
- social anxiety
- overloaded excitement

Example tendencies:

- `g-g-gary…` – “I want to say something but I’m anxious.”
- `g-gary!` – “I’m excited or scared enough that my words trip.”

### 6.2 Clustering and Spacing (Preview)

Although full syntax is in `04_syntax.md`, note that:

- Tokens in close succession (`garygary`) feel more compressed and urgent.
- Tokens with clear spacing (`gary.  gary.`) feel more composed and deliberate.

This is part morphologic (token shape) and part syntactic/pragmatic.

---

## 7. Morphological Summary

A `gary` token is the **composition** of:

- Root: `gary`
- A-modifier: length + optional diacritic
- Y-modifier: length
- Case: neutral / shout
- Punctuation: `.` `?` `!` `…`
- Optional stutter: hyphens on initial `g`

Lexical meanings (see `05_lexicon.md`) are defined for specific combinations and patterns of such tokens.
