# Garry – Core Principles

## 1. One Root

- Garry has exactly **one** lexical root: `gary`.
- A valid token **must preserve** the sequence:

> `g` followed by `a` (with optional diacritic and/or length) followed by `r` followed by `y` (with optional length).

- No other letters may intervene between these core segments.

Examples of **valid** tokens:

- `gary`
- `gaary`
- `gaaary`
- `garyy`
- `garyyy`
- `gáry`
- `gàryyy`
- `gâary`
- `gäry`
- `gãry…`
- `g-g-gary`
- `GARY!`

Examples of **invalid** tokens:

- `gar` (missing `y`)
- `gry`, `gey`, `gory`, `gery` (wrong vowel or missing segment)
- `gray` (segment order changed)
- `ga ry` (split root)
- `garys`, `garyn`, etc. (extra letters beyond modifiers)

## 2. Principle-Based Phonology

- Garry does **not** lock to one narrow IPA value.
- The `a` is any front/open vowel in the **[a ~ æ ~ ɛ]** band.
- The `y` is a high front vowel **[i ~ ɪ]**.

If a spoken form is clearly perceived as “gary” by a human listener, with a front-ish `a` and a high front `y`, it is valid.

## 3. Meaning Is Emergent

Garry is built on the following design ideas:

- **No extra vocabulary**: everything is `gary` with modifications.
- **Semantics live in modifiers**:
  - vowel length
  - diacritics
  - loudness (case)
  - punctuation
  - rhythmic effects (stutter, spacing)
  - pitch and timing
- **Syntax is pattern-based**: meaning arises from how multiple tokens are arranged and performed.

## 4. Indirect, High-Context Language

- Garry is intentionally **implied**, not explicit.
- It is designed to be:
  - a social signal language  
  - a conlang toy  
  - a way of exploring subtext and prosody
- Interpretation leans heavily on:
  - shared context
  - body language
  - prior agreements on certain patterns (the lexicon)

---

## 5. Stability vs. Play

- Core rules (this document, phonology, morphology, syntax) are **stable** and should not be casually changed.
- The **lexicon and examples** are open to expansion as long as:
  - the core root constraint is respected
  - new patterns are documented with implied glosses
  - ambiguity is embraced, not treated as a bug

Garry is minimal by **design**, not by lack of imagination.
